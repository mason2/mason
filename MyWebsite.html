    <h2>Video Games!</h2>
        <p class="games">I play lots of video games, ranging from first-person shooters to online card games. What makes a specific game interesting to me? Competition, difficulty, strategy, skill, reflex, and progression. It's a long List, but it covers almost all of the games I play. To name a few titles that I have taken a liking to lately: Overwatch, Destiny: The Taken King, Pirate101, Showdown, and battlefront.</p>
